## Introduction

SocialSprint is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. The platform empowers NGOs to list their causes with precise locations, allowing companies to easily search for and connect with causes they can support. This collaboration aims to make a significant impact on social issues by leveraging the resources and commitment of companies willing to help.

## Features

### Company Dashboard

The company dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all activities and interactions. Companies can track the causes they are supporting, monitor their contributions, and manage their profile. The dashboard also offers analytics to help companies measure the impact of their efforts.

### Search for Causes

Companies can search for causes based on location and specific interests. This feature uses geolocation to find nearby causes, making it easy for companies to support local initiatives. The search results provide detailed information about each cause, including the NGO managing it, the nature of the cause, and how companies can help.

### Personal Chat with NGOs

To foster better communication, SocialSprint includes a personal chat feature. Companies can directly message NGOs to discuss the details of a cause, ask questions, and coordinate efforts. This direct line of communication helps build strong partnerships and ensures that companies can get involved in ways that are most beneficial.

### AI-Powered Chatbot

SocialSprint includes an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with any questions they might have. The chatbot can guide users through the platform, help them find causes, and provide support for any issues they encounter. This feature ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience.

### Add Cause for NGOs

NGOs can easily add new causes through their dashboard. They can provide detailed descriptions, specify the location, and list the type of support needed. Once added, these causes become visible to companies searching for opportunities to help. This feature ensures that NGOs can effectively communicate their needs and attract the right support.

### NGO Dashboard

The NGO dashboard offers tools for managing causes, tracking support from companies, and monitoring progress. NGOs can update cause details, manage their profile, and view analytics on the support they are receiving. This centralized management system helps NGOs stay organized and maximize their impact.
